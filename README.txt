This project is a solution for CME 2204 Assignment 2, which involves designing a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach to plan a city tour for tourists. The city, represented as a graph with landmarks as vertices and streets as edges, has landmarks with attractiveness scores adjusted by visitor load and tourist interest. The objective is to create a tour route that starts and ends at the Hotel, visiting each landmark at most once (except for the Hotel, which is visited twice) and maximizing the total attractiveness score. The solution reads input from text files containing landmark data, visitor loads, and personal interests, and uses these to compute the optimal tour route.
